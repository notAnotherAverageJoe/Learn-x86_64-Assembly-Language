- Introduction
  Assembly language is a low-level programming language that provides a direct interface to the underlying hardware. Learning assembly helps you understand how software interacts with hardware, optimize code, and develop a deeper understanding of computer architecture.

This project aims to make learning x86_64 assembly language accessible and fun. You'll find step-by-step tutorials, well-commented example programs, and comprehensive explanations of core concepts.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, you'll need the following tools installed on your system:

Assembler: as (GNU Assembler)
Linker: ld (GNU Linker)
Text Editor: Any text editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode, Vim, Emacs)
Installation
Clone the Repository

```sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/notAnotherAverageJoe/Learn-x86_64-Assembly-Language
cd learn-x86_64-assembly
Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed. On a Debian-based system, you can install them using:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
Hello, World!
Start with the classic "Hello, World!" program to get a feel for writing and running assembly code.

asm
Copy code
.global \_start
.intel_syntax noprefix

\_start:
mov rax, 1 # syscall number for sys_write
mov rdi, 1 # file descriptor (stdout)
lea rsi, [rip + message] # pointer to the string
mov rdx, 14 # length of the string
syscall # invoke syscall

    mov rax, 60               # syscall number for sys_exit
    mov rdi, 0                # exit code 0
    syscall                   # invoke syscall

message:
.asciz "Hello, World!\n"
Assembling and Running
sh
Copy code
as --64 -o hello.o hello.s
ld -o hello hello.o
./hello
Basic Concepts
Registers
Learn about the general-purpose registers available in x86_64 assembly, such as rax, rbx, rcx, and rdx, and their purposes.

Memory Addressing
Understand how memory addressing works, including direct, indirect, and indexed addressing modes.

Syscalls
Explore how to interact with the operating system using system calls for performing tasks like input/output, process control, and file operations.

Examples
Check out the examples/ directory for a variety of assembly programs, ranging from simple arithmetic operations to more complex tasks like file handling and string manipulation.
